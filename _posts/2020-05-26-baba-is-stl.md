I've made an stl file for the protagonist, baba, in the game [*Baba Is You*](https://www.hempuli.com/baba/).

It is derived from the game asset sprite file, baba_0_1.png.

As the original game has a wobble effect over everything, the character is constantly animated. The left ear and right ear in this case alternates their length over frames, as in baba_0_2 and baba_0_3. I made the left ear [^1] of baba longer by 1 pixel, to make she appear more uniform, and also enables her to stand upside down, on her ears.

I drew this using some arbitrary size, 1px : 4mm, and used a thickness of 4px for I thought this could make her stand more steady. The result STL file can be downloaded at <https://hexadecimaaal.github.io/attachment/baba.stl>. Feel free to remix or to use it in anything else. Actually I'm a little afraid whether it's legal (or appropriate) to make and publish this. At least I've just input everything into Autodesk Inventor by hand, so there's no actual "usage" of the original image I guess...?

Here's what it looks like when printed out using an SLA 3D printer.

[^1]: Actually I thought these were kind of horns (and baba resembles a cattle) at first, but most people see these as ears, for baba kinds of resemble a bunny. Arvi Teikari clarified that baba doesn't resemble any specific animal, she just could be anything you like.
